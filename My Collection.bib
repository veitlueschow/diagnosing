abstract = {The existence in the ocean of deep western boundary currents, which connect the high-latitude regions where deep water is formed with upwelling regions as part of the global ocean circulation, was postulated more than 40 years ago. These ocean currents have been found adjacent to the continental slopes of all ocean basins, and have core depths between 1,500 and 4,000 m. In the Atlantic Ocean, the deep western boundary current is estimated to carry (10-40) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) of water, transporting North Atlantic Deep Water--from the overflow regions between Greenland and Scotland and from the Labrador Sea--into the South Atlantic and the Antarctic circumpolar current. Here we present direct velocity and water mass observations obtained in the period 2000 to 2003, as well as results from a numerical ocean circulation model, showing that the Atlantic deep western boundary current breaks up at 8 degrees S. Southward of this latitude, the transport of North Atlantic Deep Water into the South Atlantic Ocean is accomplished by migrating eddies, rather than by a continuous flow. Our model simulation indicates that the deep western boundary current breaks up into eddies at the present intensity of meridional overturning circulation. For weaker overturning, continuation as a stable, laminar boundary flow seems possible.},

abstract = {For the past several decades, oceanographers have embraced the dominant paradigm that the ocean's meridional overturning circulation operates like a conveyor belt, transporting cold waters equatorward at depth and warm waters poleward at the surface. Within this paradigm, the conveyor, driven by changes in deepwater production at high latitudes, moves deep waters and their attendant properties continuously along western boundary currents and returns surface waters unimpeded to deepwater formation sites. A number of studies conducted over the past few years have challenged this paradigm by revealing the vital role of the ocean's eddy and wind fields in establishing the structure and variability of the ocean's overturning. Here, we review those studies and discuss how they have collectively changed our view of the simple conveyor-belt model.},

abstract = {Using a suite of simulations with the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPIOM) at resolutions of about 0.1°, 0.4° and 1.5°, we study the impact of resolved and parameterized vertical eddy fluxes on the long-standing biases obtained when running MPIOM at low resolutions. In the 0.1° simulation, the eddy heat and salt fluxes have three features in common. First, their horizontal area averages are both upward, counteracting the downward fluxes due to time-mean circulations. Second, their divergences at intermediate depths are both negative, acting to cool and to freshen water masses, thereby reducing the major long-standing warm and saline biases of the low-resolution MPIOM at these depths. Third, both the heat and salt budgets are dominated by a balance between the divergence of eddy flux and that of mean flux. The vertical profiles of the tendency forcing due to parameterized eddies resemble those due to resolved eddies. This resemblance does not guarantee a bias reduction, as the tendency forcing terms are much less well compensated in the 0.4°- and 1.5°-simulation than in the 0.1°-simulation. When concentrating on the eddy-induced transports, we identify two situations in which the eddy effect is not appropriately represented by the GM-parameterization. One emphasizes the importance of the mean tracer distribution and the other the importance of the simulated isoneutral slope in determining the eddy-induced transports. Given the mean salinity distribution in the Southern ocean, characterized by a tongue of fresh Antarctic Intermediate Water, the salinity advection via eddy-induced transport tends to strengthen, rather than to weaken, the saline biases. Due to the density biases in a widened region of the Agulhas current in the low-resolution runs, the isoneutral slope vectors are erroneous and the large parameterized eddy-induced transports do not occur where they should.},

There is an ongoing debate on which of the two closures is better and how the spatial dependence of the eddy diffusivity should look like. To increase the physical reasoning on which these closures are based, the authors present a systematic assessment of eddy fluxes of thickness and PV and their relation to mean-flow gradients in an isopycnic eddy-resolving model of an idealized double-gyre circulation in a flat bottom, closed basin. The simulated flow features strong nonlinearities, such as tight inertial recirculations, a meandering midlatitude jet, pools of homogenized PV, and regions of weak flow where $\beta$/h dominates the PV gradient.

CFC-11 inventories between 65°N and 10°S in the Atlantic Ocean have been calculated for Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) and the components of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) from data collected primarily between 1996 and 1998 as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). CFC-11 inventories for individual water masses are 5.4 million moles for EDW, 10.5 million moles for Upper Labrador Sea Water (ULSW) (4.6 million moles south of 42°N), 23.4 million moles for Classical Labrador Sea Water (CLSW), 10.4 million moles for Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), and 8.3 million moles for Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). The estimated error for these inventories is about ±10%. The sum of the NADW components (ULSW, CLSW, ISOW, DSOW) is 53.2 million moles which is about half of the total CFC-11 inventory, 103.8 million moles, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maps of water column inventories illustrate the formation mechanisms and spreading pathways within these water masses. The inventories directly reflect the input of newly formed water in the North Atlantic over the time scale of the CFC transient, about 3 decades. The interior regions of the North Atlantic contain most (75-80%) of the CFC-11 inventory in NADW indicating strong recirculation and mixing of newly formed NADW from the DWBC into the interior with a time scale of 2-3 decades. Average water mass formation rates between 1970 and 1997 are: 3.3 Sv for EDW, 3.5 Sv for ULSW (2.0 Sv from the central Labrador Sea and 1.5 Sv from the southern Labrador Sea), 8.2 Sv for CLSW, 5.7 Sv for ISOW, and 2.2 Sv for DSOW. Estimated errors are ±20% for CLSW and ±16% for the other water masses. The total for NADW, which forms the deep limb of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, is 19.6 Sv. An extensive test of the effects of temporal variability on the average formation rate calculated from the CFC inventory indicates that the error introduced by the assumption of a constant water mass formation rate is no greater than 15% for CLSW and 10% for the other water masses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A key idea in the study of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is that its strength is proportional to the meridional density gradient, or more precisely, to the strength of the meridional pressure gradient. A physical basis that would tell us how to estimate the relevant meridional pressure gradient locally from the density distribution in numerical ocean models to test such an idea, has been lacking however. Recently, studies of ocean energetics have suggested that the AMOC is driven by the release of available potential energy (APE) into kinetic energy (KE), and that such a conversion takes place primarily in the deep western boundary currents. In this paper, we develop an analytical description linking the western boundary current circulation below the interface separating the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) to the shape of this interface. The simple analytical model also shows how available potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at each location, and that the strength of the transport within the western boundary current is proportional to the local meridional pressure gradient at low latitudes. The present results suggest, therefore, that the conversion rate of potential energy may provide the necessary physical basis for linking the strength of the AMOC to the meridional pressure gradient, and that this could be achieved by a detailed study of the APE to KE conversion in the western boundary current.},

abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation carries warm upper waters into far-northern latitudes and returns cold deep waters southward across the Equator1. Its heat transport makes a substantial contribution to the moderate climate of maritime and continental Europe, and any slowdown in the overturning circulation would have profound implications for climate change. A transatlantic section along latitude 25° N has been used as a baseline for estimating the overturning circulation and associated heat transport 2-4. Here we analyse a new 25° N transatlantic section and compare it with four previous sections taken over the past five decades. The comparison suggests that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has slowed by about 30 per cent between 1957 and 2004. Whereas the northward transport in the Gulf Stream across 25° N has remained nearly constant, the slowing is evident both in a 50 per cent larger southward-moving mid-ocean recirculation of thermocline waters, and also in a 50 per cent decrease in the southward transport of lower North Atlantic Deep Water between 3,000 and 5,000 m in depth. In 2004, more of the northward Gulf Stream flow was recirculating back southward in the thermocline within the subtropical gyre, and less was returning southward at depth. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

At 5°S, the mean from nine sections yields an NBUC transport of 26.5  3.7 Sv (Sv  106 m3 s1) along the boundary; at 11°S the mean NBUC transport from five sections is 25.4  7.4 Sv, confirming that the NBUC is already well developed at 11°S. At both latitudes a persistent offshore southward recirculation between 200- and 1100-m depth reduces the net northward warm water flow through the 5°S section (west of 31.5°W) to 22.15.3 Sv and through the 11°S section to 21.74.1 Sv (west of 32.0°W). The 4-yr-long NBUC transport time series from 11°S yields a seasonal cycle of 2.5 Sv amplitude with its northward maximum in July. Interannual NBUC transport variations are small, varying only by 1.2 Sv during the four years, with no detectable trend. The southward flow of NADW within the deep western boundary current at 5°S is 25.5  8.3 Sv with an offshore northward recirculation, yielding a nine-section mean of 20.3  10.1 Sv west of 31.5°W. For Antarctic Bottom Water, a net northward flow of 4.4  3.0 Sv is determined at 5°S. For the 11°S section, the moored array data show a pronounced energy maximum at 60–70-day period in the NADW depth range, which was identified in related work as deep eddies translating southward along the boundary. Based on a kinematic eddy model fit to the first half of the moored time series, the mean NADW transfer by the deep eddies at 11°S was estimated to be about 17 Sv. Given the large interannual variability of the deep near-boundary transport time series, which ranged from 14 to 24 Sv, the 11°S mean was considered to be not distinguishable from the mean at 5°S.},

However, the observational evidence that the strong turbulent fluxes generated by small-scale mixing in the stratified ocean interior are more vigorous close to the ocean bottom boundary than above implies that small-scale mixing converts light waters into denser ones, thus driving a net sinking of abyssal waters. Using a combination of theoretical ideas and numerical models, it is argued that abyssal waters upwell along weakly stratified boundary layers, where small-scale mixing of density decreases to zero to satisfy the no density flux condition at the ocean bottom. The abyssal ocean meridional overturning circulation is the small residual of a large net sinking of waters, driven by small-scale mixing in the stratified interior above the bottom boundary layers, and a slightly larger net upwelling, driven by the decay of small-scale mixing in the boundary layers. The crucial importance of upwelling along boundary layers in closing the abyssal overturning circulation is the main finding of this work.},

abstract = {Data from an array of six moorings deployed east of Abaco, Bahamas, along 26.5°N during March 2004–May 2005 are analyzed. These moorings formed the western boundary array of a transbasin observing system designed to continuously monitor the meridional overturning circulation and meridional heat flux in the subtropical North Atlantic, under the framework of the joint U.K.–U.S. Rapid Climate Change (RAPID)–Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) Program. Important features of the western boundary circulation include the southward-flowing deep western boundary current (DWBC) below 1000 m and the northward-flowing “Antilles” Current in the upper 1000 m. Transports in the western boundary layer are estimated from direct current meter observations and from dynamic height moorings that measure the spatially integrated geostrophic flow between moorings. The results of these methods are combined to estimate the time-varying transports in the upper and deep ocean over the width of the western boundary layer to a distance of 500 km offshore of the Bahamas escarpment. The net southward transport of the DWBC across this region, inclusive of northward deep recirculation, is −26.5 Sv (Sv 106 m3 s−1), which is divided nearly equally between upper (−13.9 Sv) and lower (−12.6 Sv) North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). In the top 1000 m, 6.0 Sv flows northward in a thermocline-intensified jet near the western boundary. These transports are found to agree well with historical current meter data in the region collected between 1986 and 1997. Variability in both shallow and deep components of the circulation is large, with transports above 1000 m varying between −15 and +25 Sv and deep transports varying between −60 and +3 Sv. Much of this transport variability, associated with barotropic fluctuations, occurs on relatively short time scales of several days to a few weeks. Upon removal of the barotropic fluctuations, slower baroclinic transport variations are revealed, including a temporary stoppage of the lower NADW transport in the DWBC during November 2004.},

abstract = {The role of mesoscale oceanic eddies in driving the large-scale currents is studied in an eddy-resolving, double-gyre ocean model. The new diagnostic method is proposed, which is based on dynamical decomposition of the flow into the large-scale and eddy components. The method yields the time history of the eddy forcing, which can be used as additional, external forcing in the corresponding non-eddy-resolving model of the gyres. The main strength of this approach is in its dynamical consistency: the non-eddy-resolving solution driven by the eddy forcing history correctly approximates the original large-scale flow component. It is shown that statistical decompositions, which are based on space-time filtering diagnostics, are dynamically inconsistent. The diagnostics algorithm is formulated and tested, and the diagnosed eddies are analysed, both statistically and dynamically. It is argued that the main dynamic role of the eddies is to maintain the eastward-jet extension of the subtropical western boundary current (WBC). This is done largely by both the time-mean isopycnal-thickness flux and the relative-vorticity eddy flux fluctuations. The fluctuations drive large-scale flow through the nonlinear rectification mechanism. The relative-vorticity flux contributes mostly to the eastward jet meandering. Finally, eddy fluxes driven by both the eddies and the large-scale flow are found to be important. The latter is typically neglected in the analysis, but here it corresponds to important large-scale feedback on the eddies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Time-mean eddy fluxes of temperature, isopycnic thickness, and quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity are diagnosed on level surfaces from 5 years of model data and are spatially correlated with the corresponding time-mean gradients. We find no discernible correlation between the absolute eddy fluxes and mean gradients. However, after decomposing the eddy fluxes into "rotational" and "divergent" components we find a positive correlation between the divergent eddy fluxes and the mean gradients, although the overall correlation coefficients remain small, typically O(0.2). The correlation between the eddy temperature fluxes and mean temperature gradients is positive only over the upper 2 km and is negative at depth, suggesting that the abyssal temperature fluxes are upgradient. In contrast, the correlations between eddy fluxes and mean gradients of isopycnic thickness and potential vorticity are positive over the most of the fluid column. The overall correlations are similar for both thickness and potential vorticity closures. We further decompose the divergent component of the eddy fluxes into components directed perpendicular and parallel to mean contours. We find that both the perpendicular and the parallel components are similar in magnitude. Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.},

A mean Antilles Current, with 5 Sv of northward transport, is confined against the Bahamas boundary in the upper 800 m and combines with approximately 19 Sv of Florida Current transport to balance the Sverdrup interior circulation, and does not contribute to interhemispheric exchange. The mean transport of the deep western boundary current (DWBC) off the Bahamas is approximately 40 Sv, of which 13 Sv compensates the upper branch of the thermohaline circulation, requiring a 27 Sv deep recirculation. Robust annual and semiannual cycles of meridional are found in both moored observations and model results with remarkable agreement in amplitude (±13 Sv) and phase.

abstract = {To understand how our global climate will change in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing, it is essential to determine how quickly and by what pathways climate change signals are transported throughout the global ocean, a vast reservoir for heat and carbon dioxide. Labrador Sea Water (LSW), formed by open ocean convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, is a particularly sensitive indicator of climate change on interannual to decadal timescales. Hydrographic observations made anywhere along the western boundary of the North Atlantic reveal a core of LSW at intermediate depths advected southward within the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). These observations have led to the widely held view that the DWBC is the dominant pathway for the export of LSW from its formation site in the northern North Atlantic towards the Equator. Here we show that most of the recently ventilated LSW entering the subtropics follows interior, not DWBC, pathways. The interior pathways are revealed by trajectories of subsurface RAFOS floats released during the period 2003-2005 that recorded once-daily temperature, pressure and acoustically determined position for two years, and by model-simulated 'e-floats' released in the subpolar DWBC. The evidence points to a few specific locations around the Grand Banks where LSW is most often injected into the interior. These results have implications for deep ocean ventilation and suggest that the interior subtropical gyre should not be ignored when considering the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

abstract = {To assess whether the southward deep water flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation can be monitored by measuring the deep western boundary current, the structure and transport of the time-averaged deep western boundary current at 26.5N are estimated from long current meter records deployed in a series of 7 mooring deployments over 11 years from March 1986 to June 1997 east of Abaco Island in the Bahamas. Time-averaged meridional velocities for each current meter record are combined into estimates of mean velocity at 3 to 10 depths at 10 mooring locations extending eastward from the continental slope out to an offshore distance of 580 km. The mean deep western boundary current below 1000 m depth exhibits a core of strong southward velocities above 15 cm s-1 at an offshore distance of about 55 km and extends out to an offshore distance of about 160 km with an estimated total southward transport of 34.6 Sv. We estimate the error in this time-averaged transport to be 3.7 Sv due to uncertainties in the mean velocities due to temporal variability and up to 4 Sv due to the choice of methods to integrate spatially the time-averaged velocities across the section. Offshore from 160 km out to at least 580 km, there is broad, slow northward flow that recirculates deep water northward. While the mooring array is not sufficient to accurately measure the northward recirculation, a simple spatial average of the time-averaged currents indicates a northward recirculation of about 13 Sv in this offshore region. Daily estimates of the deep western boundary current from two arrays with reasonably complete coverage of the deep western boundary current suggest that the instantaneous boundary current has a width of about 100 km, naturally narrower than the mean boundary current. Daily southward transports vary between 5 and 75 Sv but the array does not fully resolve the boundary current during offshore meander events that occur about 20% of the time. We conclude that it is problematic to monitor the net southward flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation with boundary current measurements at 26.5N because the narrow deep western boundary current transport has substantially larger transport than the net southward flow and the offshore northward recirculation is broad and diffuse so that accurate estimates of the recirculation would require an extensive array of moored instruments.},

abstract = {This paper presents an estimate of the oceanic Lorenz energy cycle derived from a 1 10 simulation forced by 6-hourly fluxes obtained from NCEP–NCARreanalysis-1. The total rate of energy generation amounts to 6.6 TW, of which 1.9 TW is generated by the time-mean winds and 2.2 TW by the time-varying winds. The dissipation of kinetic energy amounts to 4.4 TW, of which 3 TWoriginate from the dissipation of eddy kinetic energy. The energy exchange between reservoirs is dominated by the baroclinic pathway and the pathway that distributes the energy generated by the time-mean winds. The former converts 0.7 to 0.8TWmean available potential energy to eddy available potential energy and finally to eddy kinetic energy, whereas the latter converts 0.5 TW mean kinetic energy to mean available potential energy. This energy cycle differs from the atmospheric one in two aspects. First, the generation of the mean kinetic and mean available potential energy is each, to a first approximation, balanced by the dissipation. The in- teraction of the oceanic general circulation with mesoscale eddies is hence less crucial than the corresponding interaction in the atmosphere. Second, the baroclinic pathway in the ocean is facilitated not only by the surface buoyancy flux but also by the winds through a conversion of 0.5 TW mean kinetic energy to mean available potential energy. In the atmosphere, the respective conversion is almost absent and the baroclinic energy pathway is driven solely by the differential heating.},

Rigorous pre- and post- deployment in situ calibration of the density sensors and subsequent data processing establish an accuracy of O(1.5 Sv) in internal transport in the 1200-5000 dbar range at subinertial time scales. A similar accuracy is reached in the bottom pressure-derived external transport fluctuations.

abstract = {Five years of data from a line of dynamic height moorings (DHM), bottom-pressure recorders (BPR), and pressure-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIES) near the Atlantic Ocean western boundary at 26.5??N are used to evaluate the structure and variability of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) during 2004-2009. Comparisons made between transports estimated from the DHM+BPR and those made by the PIES demonstrate that the two systems are collecting equivalent volume transport information (correlation coefficient r=0.96, root-mean-square difference=6Sv; 1Sv=106m3s-1). Integrated to $\sim$450km off from the continental shelf and between 800 and 4800dbar, the DWBC has a mean transport of approximately 32Sv and a standard deviation during these five years of 16Sv. Both the barotropic (full-depth vertical mean) and baroclinic flows have significant variability (changes exceeding 10Sv) on time scales ranging from a few days to months, with the barotropic variations being larger and more energetic at all time scales. The annual cycle of the deep transport is highly dependent on the horizontal integration distance; integrating $\sim$100km offshore yields an annual cycle of roughly similar magnitude but shifted in phase relative to that found from current meter arrays in the 1980-1990s, while the annual cycle becomes quite weak when integrating $\sim$450km offshore. Variations in the DWBC transport far exceed those of the total basin-wide Meridional Overturning Circulation (standard deviations of 16Sv vs. 5Sv). Transport integrated in the deep layer out to the west side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge still demonstrates a surprisingly high variance, indicating that some compensation of the western basin deep variability must occur in the eastern basin. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Abstract The rectified eddy heat transport is calculated from a global high-resolution ocean general circulation model. The eddy heat transport is found to be strong in the western boundary currents, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the equatorial region. It is generally weak in the central gyres. It is also found to be largely confined to the upper 1000 m of the ocean model. The eddy heat transport is separated into its rotational and divergent components. The rotational component of the eddy heat transport is strong in the western boundary currents, while the divergent component is strongest in the equatorial region and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In the equatorial region, the eddy heat transport is due to tropical instability waves, while in the western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current the large eddy heat transports arise from the meandering of the currents. Stammer's method for estimating the eddy heat transport from an eddy diffusivity derived from mixing length arguments, using altimetry data and the climatological temperature field, is tested and fails to reproduce the model's directly evaluated eddy heat transport in the equatorial regions, and possible reasons for the discrepancy are explored. However, in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region and to a lesser extent in the western boundary currents, the model's eddy heat transport is shown to have some qualitative agreement with his estimate.},
